# Kubernetes Cluster Setup

Before we set up the Kubernetes Goat, we need to have a working Kubernetes cluster admin access.

There are many ways you can run the Kubernetes Cluster. Some of them include running in

* Cloud provider Kubernetes service (like GKE, EKS, AKS, DO, etc.)
* Locally provisioned cluster
* Minikube environnement
* Katacoda Playground

Refer to the Kubernetes setup documentation for more information and details at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
